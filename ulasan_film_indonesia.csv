Laskar Pelangi,Anonim,"Terlepas dari kekurangannya, Laskar Pelangi adalah film fenomenal yang membuka mata Indonesia akan kondisi pendidikan yg belum semuanya memadai. Tentu ini juga karena materi dari bukunya memang bagus, banyak momen haru biru yg membuat kita meneteskan air mata.Walaupun setelahnya kita pikir2 lagi, baik buku dan film bukan 100% pengalaman nyata, melainkan ada dramatisasinya.

Penggambarannya juga legit dengan pov anak-anak usia menuju remaja.Untuk akting para pemeran dewasa bagus. Sayangnya, untuk pemeran anak-anak, menurutku ada beberapa yang kurang natural—di beberapa adegan bahkan tampak dibuat-buat. Meski demikian, penataan tampilan anak-anak keren sih.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"2012 RankingThe adrenaline rush you get from this film is insane, definitely the cinematic equivalent of a pre-workout supplement. 100 minutes of non-stop carnage and tension with just enough plot and surprises to take it from one point to the next.

It provides you with very minimal storyline but a whole host of non stop, mind-blowing and creative action/fight scenes that at times left me speechless and as a whole I'm usually not the biggest fan of these types of films but I could not take my eyes off the screen.To put it in a less than elegant way the raid is basically John wick on crack before John wick had even come about. An absolute must watch for the action film fan.",4.5 stars

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,'The Raid' is probably my favourite from the recent crop of action movies. Early on the throttle is glued down and the film becomes relentless.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"Apart from the magnificent hand-to-hand combats, what stood out to me the most is the fact that, unlike mainstream Hollywood blockbusters, the band of protagonists take numerous hits on their bodies. They get beaten up pretty badly because they aren’t invincible, they don't possess superhuman abilities, and they do not represent the ‘archetype’ definition of a typical action lead. And that, in my view, makes these circumstances more believable and scary.",4.0 stars
The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"every time I watch a movie like this it just confirms for me that Hollywood is so much worse at making action movies than everyone else.While not quite as brutal or action packed as something like The Night Comes For Us or The Sadness (which to be fair is a horror movie), this also predates both of those and seeing this I have to imagine that this was an influence on both of those.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"Really sucks that one of the best Indonesian martial arts action films of all time is undercut in the major releases bc, at least in America, the most available version is a terrible English dub.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"Despite the story feeling a bit formulated and predictable, this was an extremely impressive, intense, action-packed, over the top, and crazy movie that you just have to watch to truly experience it. The amount of effort and detail put into the action sequences was beyond impressive, great music choices, really engaging with a great sense of tone. There were some flaws for sure: there were a few clichés, a few goofy stock sound effects, a couple of stupid characters (a few of soldiers made decisions like it was their first day on the job...).

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"The violence is excessive and engorging - what surprised me the most was how economical the storytelling was. In fight scenes, our characters flail wildly in a storm of bloodshed; yet each fight scene builds upon the last with careful precision.

Masterful choreography.",3.5 stars

The basic concept actually works in its favour as the film doesn't become bogged down with unnecessary subplots or characters.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"77/100Had to watch the dubbed version and unfortunately the voice actors are absolutely GODAWFUL!! It makes this film very tough to watch. However, the action is so nonstop, so kick-ass that it makes the dialogue worth stomaching. Some of the choreographed lifts and tosses are inhuman and plain ridiculous, but the majority of the action is fun and the violence and gore strikes a tasteful balance between bloody fun, but not torture porn indulgence. I just wish I could've gotten my hands on the subbed version and perhaps my opinion would be much greater. Maybe next time.",3.5 stars
The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"Con qualche anno di ritardo mi aggiungo al coro degli entusiasti per questo avvincente action-movie che riesce a combinare adrenalina e stile con eccellente equilibrio, senza essere mai retorico né patetico. I combattimenti a mani nude o all'arma bianca sono il pezzo forte e, nonostante alcuni siano portati all'eccesso, vorresti comunque che non finissero mai. Sicuramente merito di un montaggio serratissimo che assesta qualche sbavatura di regia. Il film intrattiene, appaga lo sguardo e riesce anche a porre una questione morale sul senso di giustizia, senza didascalismi inutili. A breve mi sparerò il seguito, spero sullo stesso livello di questo.",4.0 stars

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,The Raid is one of the best action films of the 2010s. It brought new life into the martial arts genre and a wonderfully brutal. The fight sequences were terrific with characters using everything they can as weapons.

The plot was basic but most people will forget that and Gareth Evans freely admitted that The Warriors and Die Hard as influences.,4.5 stars
The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"One thing that I’ve learned is that to make a great film, you don’t always have to put character first. Sometimes, it’s okay to rely on the experience of a movie, and oh boy, is this movie an exhilarating experience. Not to say that there isn’t character in this, there are certainly arcs to drive the plot, but the action is really the driving force. The fight choreography is never stale, because it always finds new ways to give the audience a trip with the amazing camerawork. This is just action at its finest, nothing more, nothing less.

I've been dying to have a movie marathon night of watching The Raid, Punisher: War Zone, and Dredd. 3 films that all carry a similar set up for the story and action.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"Brisk, excellently made action film that's already ascended into a modern genre classic. Several scenes are more intense than films with exponentially larger budgets, the cast performs extremely admirably in their roles where the majority of the acting must be done with physicality that most of us could never hope to replicate, and the climactic fight is literally breathtaking. The setting inherently limits visual variety, but the pacing between action sequences and ""quieter"" scenes is smart. The sequel is already in my que.",4.5 stars

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"There's something about Gareth Evans' film making style. Somehow, upon multiple rewatches, ""The Raid"" has not only retained all the freshness and spectacular scale, but actually gained a lot as an action film. It still didn't top my all-time favourite action film (""Die Hard""), but it's damn close. If anything, Evans proves with this film that you don't need a crap-tonne of TNT, expensive motion capture or A-list celebrities to deliver in the adrenaline department. With only camera tricks, practical effects and - most of all - stunning fight scene choreography, ""The Raid"" can now stand proudly on my shelf among the best action films.",5.0 stars

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"This was a pretty rockin' action flick. I think the 2012 film Dredd was heavily influenced by this film. The premise, setting, and violence levels are remarkably similar. But I liked Dredd, and I like this film as well.Nice hand to hand fighting choreography, as well as some of the most original ways to kill a person I've ever seen are on display here. The plot is simple, but this movie is more about the spectacle of action, like a Jackie Chan movie.Really enjoyed it. I will be checking out the sequel.B+Trinity",4.0 stars
The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"One of three films (along with  Martyrs  and  Gravity ) during which I had to consciously remind myself to breathe properly. The fight choreography is just ridiculous in the best possible way. And the direction enhances it. The camera is everywhere, and every drop of tension is painstakingly wrung out.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"Absolutely perfect straight forward martial arts action flick. One might complain that there's no story or they could have expanded on these characters but it works well as a shorter tighter runtime.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"Balls-to-the-fucking-wall. After the first 10 minutes, this movie just will not let up. This is propulsive, linear, instantly iconic storytelling— Assault on Precinct 13 meets Mad Max: Fury Road with an extra dose of grime.

The Raid: Redemption,Anonim,"OMFG, another to add to my personal list of hyperviolent and stylish siege action movies! (With Punisher Warzone and Dredd) A wild 101-minute ride of non-stop, high-octane action. The fight choreography is genuinely incredible—fast, brutal, and expertly executed. Much like Dredd, the rundown apartment block setting becomes almost a character of its own, with walls shattering, furniture being used as weapons, and creative use of lighting and vertical space delivering some truly spectacular—and nerve-wracking—action scenes.I need more like this!

Still, even with this fourth return to Gareth Evans’ boiling pot of violence, corruption, and survival, I was found, once again, teetering on the edge amidst the erupted chaos. The deepest satisfaction could only be described by its eventual transition from tactical gunplay to neck-breaking hand-to-hand combat, without a fade in impact within this alteration, but rather compounding it. Its entirety feels akin to a contemporary dopamine hit but without the self-deprecating side effect often carried with it. This perhaps explains the ongoing enthusiasm to return time and time again.",Tidak ada rating

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"Pengabdi setan dibuat dengan sangat baik. Gaya horornya masih Joko anwar sekali dengan simbol, misteri dan semacamnya. Film ini bahkan membuat sound iconicnya sendiri sengan Lonceng, mirip dengan gaya Hereditary lewat ketokan meja dan dinding. Narasinya terbangun dengan kokoh dari awal dan alurnya mempertahankan film originalnya (di Improvisasi ujungnya). Tapi yang membuat saya paling kagum adalah kepiawaian Joko Anwar membuat plot hole menjadi media diskusi. Apakah ini hasil ekspektasi penonton atau memang disengaja. Saya juga tidak tahu. Jika ditanya suka yang mana dari dua versi Pengabdi setan yang ada, maka saya akan pilih dua-duanya. Keduanya punya cerita yang berbeda dan sama-sama menarik. Kenapa harus memilih?",3.5 stars

But for me, moment yang paling nyeremin justru bukan pas ada jumpscare nya.

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,A bit unsatisfying but tender and heartfelt in a way these types of haunted house movies often aren’t.  And the lead is a huge part of why it’s so effective without needing to make her some kind of invulnerable heroine.

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"So, after watching Joko Anwar's new horror flick Impetigore, which I loved, I had to go back and watch Satan's Slaves, Anwar's previous film that I've been hearing praise for since it came out a couple years ago, and I have proceeded to sleep on ever since for no reason at all. So now that I've seen it, I have to say it's pretty good. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely worth seeing, and it had super creepy atmosphere…",4.0 stars

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"A semi remake of an early 80s Indonesian classic. Anwar keeps most of the basic structure and updates it. While it’s 2 hours long it never drags, has some genuinely interesting (but never cheesy) family moments and some great atmosphere.

As someone who has claustrophobia there’s a particularly nasty scene.",4.5 stars

Makes a refreshing change to see another religion instead of Christianity at the helm of a ghost story.The scare tactics were those of the tried and tested method rather than anything to experimental but they still packed a punch! The sets were great, awesome little cast with likeable characters and decent special effects. I really enjoyed this film considering I expected a cheap lousy horror flick…the title and poster really don’t do this movie justice. Where can I get that vinyl from 🎼",4.0 stars
Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"The first part feels a bit like The Conjuring, and the final part feels like Night of the Living Dead.

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"A remarkably well crafted ghost story, with echoes of The Ring, The Others, Rosemary’s Baby, and even Night of the Living Dead. While the narrative itself feels a bit like a template of those films (and countless others), the frights are engineered with striking effectiveness and the pacing keeps things from ever getting bogged down with too many familiar elements. It’s worth the time of even the most casual fan of spectral horror movies, and more so for those inclined to appreciate the classic haunted family stories of Poltergeist or The Conjuring.",4.5 stars

It’s still way better than the original & extremely creepy at times. For all those saying this is a bad “cliche’” horror film... maybe look that it’s a remake of an early 80’s film before you criticize. 🧐,3.5 stars
Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,31 Nights of Horror - Day 13Wow!This is really an underrated Asian horror gem. The plot is not really new but the way it's executed makes it look fresh. The cinematography is smartly executed and there are moments which really takes you by surprise and I'm not talking about the jump scare kinda surprise (which also worked pretty good in this movie) but some genuine terror. The ending especially the last scene was a clever twist in my opinion. Overall a definite recommendation.,4.0 stars

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"Substitutes the original's reassuring faith in religious absolution with faith in the collective strength of the familial unit as a means to counter evil. But just when it gets too hopeful, Joko Anwar reveals a more prevading sense of pessimism about any lasting invulnerability against unspeakable, oppressive forces that are well beyond anyone's control. To quote John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness: ""In fact, YOU WILL NOT BE SAVED AT ALL."" Several beats in this are fairly typical to a lot…",4.0 stars

The atmosphere is delicious and the tension is unrelenting.I also really liked some of the stylistic touches like the title card typography and music.I think near the end things starts to get a bit old with the repeated formulaic jump scares. As with a lot of horror movies the climax didn't really work for me - its loud and chaotic and the tension is completely gone.,3.5 stars
Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,Nothing ground breaking but I enjoyed myself. Doesn't really to heavily on religious stuff,3.5 stars
Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"Aa pretty good spooky venture. It felt like a cross between your typical cult movie, a Conjuring movie and also night of the living the dead. The actors did a pretty convincing job and the atmosphere definitely was creepy thoughout. One thing I could've done without was the excessive amount of jump scares. I would probably watch this again around Halloween and have a few drinks to it though.",3.0 stars

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"Con claras influencias del terror asiático y J-Horror de The Ring y el estilo James Wan de The Conjuring resulta un interesante y disfrutable producto de terror indonesio grabado en tan solo 18 días.La película comienza muy fuerte en su primer tercio pero en mi opinión se va desinflando y va perdiendo fuerza tanto en trama como en efectividad de los sustos y la generación de mal rollo. Además, para mi gusto abusa demasiado de las subidas de música en los momentos de tensión y susto. Pese a esto es un producto disfrutable y que recomiendo su visionado a todo el aficionado al terror.",3.0 stars

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"Appropriately moody and atmospheric, this Indonesian haunter doesn't do anything shockingly original but neither does it fall flat on its face. It's a slow burn that builds to a pretty pulse-pounding third act siege. There are so jump scares, of course, and those are always fun but they don't overdo it and they build too them in unexpected ways. The acting, especially from the child performers, is very solid and the sense of family is very real. I've read they're considering a sequel and I would definitely check it out if it's realized. Good scare stuff.",3.5 stars

It raises the number of Rini’s siblings, lowers the family’s socioeconomic status (their house is being foreclosed as well as haunted), deepens the characters and elaborates the supernatural plotting – all to confound our expectations and disorient our moral compass as we are kept guessing what is happening and who exactly is accommodating the resident evil.

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,"before this rewatch i've seen this movie on teather two times... indeed the best indonesian horror to date, the atmospheric creepiness is what gets me on every rewatch. on first watch it's probably hard to piece together the story -- on why the youngest kid gets haunted by the spirit of the grandmother etc but it was all clear on second watch. kinda dislike the walking dead-ish ending tho. it really /was/ zombie apocalypse. this supposed to have a sequel since the oldest girl picked up that.. red thing that directly connected to the satanic cult soooo i'm excited",4.5 stars

Pengabdi Setan,Anonim,Beat horror of Indonesia .นี่คือหนังผีที่ผมดูแล้วถึงกับบอกว่า น่ากลัวที่สุดเรื่องหนึ่งเท่าที่เคยดูมา และ สมกับที่คนยกย่องว่า  Joko Anwar คือ ผู้กำกับหนังผีอินโดนีเซียที่เก่งที่สุดคนหนึ่งในประวัติศาสตร์.รินี่ หญิงสาวที่พึ่งสูญเสียคุณแม่ไปอย่างปริศนาได้พบว่าครอบครัวของเธอที่ประกอบด้วยพี่น้องอีกสามคนได้ถูกคุกคามบางสิ่ง บางสิ่งที่กำลังจะมาเอาชีวิตพวกเธอไป นั่นทำให้รินี่และพ่อของเธอรวมทั้งน้อง ๆ ต้องหาทางเอาตัวรอดจากสถานการณ์นี้ โดยไม่รู้ว่า สิ่งที่กำลังไล่ล่าพวกเขานั้นคือ ญินชั่วร้ายที่ต้องการเอาพวกเขาไปลงนรกด้วยกันทั้งหมด.ทำไม่มันถึงมาไล่ล่าพวกเขากัน และ จะเอาตัวรอดไปได้ไหม ?.นั่งดูจบผมต้องบอกเลยว่า สมแล้วที่คนบอกว่า หนังของ Joko Anwar มันเฮี้ยน และ เฮี้ยนจริงชนิดว่ายังจดจำหลายซีนของหนังได้ไม่ลืมครับ มันทำให้รู้สึกเหมือนกำลังนั่งดู hereditary ฉบับอิสลามที่ช่วงท้ายกลายเป็น Zombie + The Beyond ไปเลย ใช่ครับ มันคือ หนังที่ทำให้ผมแอบยิ้มไปตลอดเพราะ หนังมันทำให้ผมนึกถึงหนังสยองขวัญอิตาเลี่ยนที่ทั้งโหด บ้าคลั่ง และชั่วร้ายได้ชัดเจน.หนังสยองขวัญอิตาลีนั้นขึ้นชื่อด้านความโหดเหี้ยม สิ้นหวัง งานเมคอัพที่สมจริง แน่นอนว่า หนังไม่มีความปราณีปราศรัยใด ๆ กับตัวละครทั้งนั้น ทุกตัวละครของหนังสยองขวัญอิตาลีเลยตายได้หมด ไม่ว่าคุณจะเป็นนักบวช แม่ชีไปจนถึงเด็ก มันไม่สนใจ และ มันเอาพวกคุณมาใช้งานเพื่อฆ่าคนต่อ และ เหมือนงานของลูซิโอ ฟัลซี่ที่เรียกว่า น่าจะเป็นแรงบันดาลใจสำคัญให้หนังเรื่องนี้ตั้งแต่ต้นฉบับแล้ว เพียงแค่ว่า Joko Anwar แกเอามารีอิมเมจใหม่จนน่ากลัวชิบหายแทน.แน่นอนว่า หนังมันพูดถึงความศรัทธาว่า เราศรัทธาพระเจ้าไหม เป็นเหมือนคำถามที่หนังถามใส่ครอบครัวนางเอกตลอดเวลาว่า ละมาดไหม และ…,5.0 stars

Gruesome, but not gratuitous, bloody, but not gory, short, but not insignificant. That one got me and there are a couple other scenes (especially in the last 20 minutes or so) that hit home nicely here that take a lackluster horror film into a pretty decent one.",3.5 stars

No worth.And people still ask why she joined a satanic cult?

Dilan 1990,Anonim,"Sebagai film yang mengambil setting tahun 90-an, Dilan 1990 cukup berhasil mengangkat nostalgia lewat gaya pacaran jadul: surat, binder, motor CB, dan bahasa yang agak puitis tapi kaku.Dari segi cerita memang sederhana, tapi justru di situlah daya tariknya: hubungan dua anak SMA yang punya dunianya sendiri. Gaya bicara Dilan yang puitis bisa terasa cringe, tapi buat sebagian orang bisa memunculkan memori masa lalu.Akting? Biasa aja. Tapi untuk standar film remaja lokal, ini cukup menempel di ingatan. Film ini terasa fresh waktu pertama nonton karena membawa warna yang beda.",3.5 stars

Dilan 1990,Anonim,"Dilan 1990"" adalah film yang berhasil mencuri hati banyak penonton dengan kisah cinta remaja yang manis dan menggemaskan. Ceritanya tentang Milea, seorang siswi pindahan, dan Dilan, cowok bad boy tapi romantis yang bikin hati Milea meleleh. Setting tahun 90-an bikin film ini punya nuansa nostalgia yang kuat. Dialog-dialognya, terutama gombalan Dilan, jadi sangat ikonik dan sering diulang-ulang.

Beberapa adegan terasa murahan, seperti saat Milea dan Bunda Dilan pulang ke rumah, di mana editing CGI-nya kasar dan transisinya sangat jelas menggunakan gambar bulan dari NASA.

5cm,Anonim,"Film ini tuh kayak motivasi visual buat anak muda yang pengen nanjak gunung, tapi takut sama realita. 5 cm sukses bikin lo pengen ngejar mimpi, walaupun dialognya kadang terlalu teatrikal. Chemistry antar geng solid, dan visual gunung Semeru bikin film ini visually stunning. Tapi, kalau lo liat lebih dalem, storytelling-nya rada berat di drama yang nggak selalu terasa natural. It’s a love letter to friendship and dreams, walaupun agak terlalu dramatis di beberapa momen (Especially pas sudah sampai di puncak, itu agak overdramatic dan gak masuk akal sih).

KKN di Desa Penari,Anonim,"Setelah sekian lama, akhirnya nonton KKN di Desa Penari Extended Version.Tambahan scene memang ada, tapi dari segi rasa tetap sama: horornya nanggung, malah kadang berasa kayak film horor-komedi karena ada karakter yang kebanyakan becanda.Jujur, kalau lu udah baca thread atau novelnya, film ini gak akan kasih pengalaman baru.Sound design lumayan oke, tapi terlalu banyak jump scare suara doang tanpa build up yang beneran bikin tegang.Buat gue pribadi, horor kalau diselipin terlalu banyak komedi malah bikin feel-nya aneh.Jadi intinya, extended version ini cuma nambahin scene, tapi gak nambah rasa.",3.0 stars

Adegan saat dia menari terlihat sangat indah, dan aktris yang memerankannya berhasil membawakannya dengan baik.Apakah ini film horor yang bagus? Tidak.

Nur, Widya, Ayu, Bima, Anton, dan Wahyu diberikan berbagai arahan dan pantangan karena desa tersebut dianggap keramat.Dari segi cerita, film ini menawarkan ide yang cukup segar dan menarik.

Cerita diambil dari sebuah thread twitter yang cukup banyak mendapatkan perhatian pengguna twitter pada saat itu. Cerita dimulai dari sekelompok mahasiswa yang melaksanakan program KKN, selama melaksanakan program KKN tersebut mereka kerap kali diganggu oleh penunggu di desa tersebut. Puncak cerita dari film ini adalah, dua orang dari mahasiswa KKN tersebut melakukan perbuatan tidak terpuji yang membuat mereka harus menanggung akibat dari perbuatan mereka. Untuk film horor, kesan menakutkan yang diberikan oleh film ini masih kurang, tetapi dari segi cerita film ini tetap seru dan dapat dinikmati.",4.0 stars

Dibilang seram juga nggak, menurut saya lebih mirip film azab karena berbuat hal yang tidak senonoh dan mengganggu penghuni ghaib di desa tersebut.

KKN di Desa Penari,Anonim,"Sedikit berharap plot-nya ngga terlalu mencontek thread asli karena seharusnya ada beberapa scene yang menurutku punya banyak potensi untuk digali lebih dalam agar tempo filmnya tidak terlalu buru-buru dan terasa kasar. Untuk pengambilan gambar (tipikal film horror indonesia), sinematografi serta tone-nya bisa dibilang lumayan. Penampilan Adinda Thomas (Widya) dan Tissa Biani (Nur) menurutku berhasil memerankan peran tersebut dengan baik di antara yang lain. Kekurangannya yaitu backsound-nya menurutku terlalu berisik, niatnya agar terasa lebih horror, tapi nyatanya sedikit menggangu.",2.5 stars
KKN di Desa Penari,Anonim,"Absolute brilliant performance from the casts. I think a lot of people are bit disappointed that the movie is not as scary as they thought it would be. However,  i feel like the movie focused more on regret and trauma. Besides, this is based on a real story and that itself is enough to make you feel scary. I can’t imagine how traumatic it must be for Widya to experience all that. It’s a 10/10 from me. Hell i would love for the director to make a film series of KKN like the Harry Potter/ Star Wars.

Selipan humornya pas dan efektif, aksinya menarik, dan CGI-nya pun tak buruk.

Seakan - akan ada gaya tarik menarik diantara mereka berdua tentang pandanganya terhadap bagaimana membantu rakyat dengan benar. Alignment Sancaka yang terombang ambing dari true neutral menjadi lawful good dengan naluri intrisik dibangun dengan terciptanya antitesis dari lawful evil yaitu Pangkor. Narasi tentang kebenaran yang sebenarnya akan rakyat juga selalu menimbulkan teka teki dan sesuatu yang akan terus dipikirkan oleh penonton, well done Joko Anwar for the starters.",3.5 stars
Gundala,Anonim,"Setiap karakter pentolan yang ditampilkan begitu ramai sekali di kepala dan tetap permasalahan CGI di beberapa momennya terkadang masih mengganggu. Namun, sebagai film pembuka Jagad Sinema Bumilangit, Gundala berhasil menampilkan patriotnya dengan tampil mempesona, menyuguhkan musuh yang beragam juga lebih kuat, dan menaruh beberapa misteri atau teka-teki kepada benak penontonnya untuk dipecahkan di film superhero asli Indonesia berikutnya. Sebuah pondasi yang cukup baik.",3.5 stars

Sancaka dewasa jadi kaku dan datar banget ya. Untuk segi cerita, kurasa banyak bolongnya yang terkesan tiba-tiba. Ditambah karakter 'Gundala' sendiri seperti tidak menjadi peran utama di filmnya. Satu hal lagi, adegan berkelahi disini pun terasa lambat dan kaku, sehingga kayak ga natural dilihatnya. Overall, aku suka dengan film Gundala.

Gundala,Anonim,"I've seen worse super hero movies (from the DC universe anyway). Honestly, this was surprisingly good.

Especially because it's not just any Indonesian superhero movie, it's the first film in the BUMILANGIT CINEMATIC UNIVERSE.

Gundala,Anonim,"Desde luego, tiene un mejor inicio que cualquiera de las grandes sagas de superhéroes actuales. Muy sólida y con cositas que le dan personalidad como las brillantes coreografías que tiene, pero al fin y al cabo no deja de ser una película que te introduce a los personajes que van a desarrollar en el futuro y eso hace que su ritmo decaiga bastante a lo largo de sus dos horazas.

Terlihat dari konflik, karakter, dan beberapa dialog serta motif karakter dibuat seolah-olah ingin jadi jembatan universe yang baik. Tidak salah sebenarnya, permasalahannya adalah Joko Anwar terlalu fokus di peluasan universe sampai-sampai mengesampingkan aspek cerita di Gundala. CGI di Gundala pun tampak kurang mulus, editor di Indonesia masih harus banyak-banyak belajar lagi dari Hollywood, padahal Gundala ini bisa aja diceritain tanpa superpower-nya, barulah di sekuel di buatkan kekuatannya.

The visuals and action scenes are quite impressive, showing the potential of local productions to compete with international standards. However, the story still feels a bit weak and underdeveloped.

Gundala,Anonim,I have too much to say about this movie so i'll try to keep this short. The opening showing Sancaka's backstory is incredibly good and gets us to root for him. But once he grows up the movie starts to fall off. Too many characters. Villain's plan is incredibly stupid. A boring subplot about politics. The hero and villain don't even meet until the final battle. Then there's a very confusing cameo by a character who's going to have her…,3.0 stars

Gundala,Anonim,"Gundala jadi Film Bumilangit pertama, karakter yang diciptakan oleh Hasmi ini diadaptasi menjadi film, namun sayang, film ini begitu membosankan menjelang akhir, terutama saya kecewa dengan adegan laga akhir yang begitu melehoy, apalagi harus nunggu satu-satu dulu buat lawan Gundala di Rooftop macam Karakter Game yang nunggu karakter utamanya selesai wkwkw, Dibandingkan dengan karakter Pengkor, saya justru lebih suka dengan Karakter Ghazul yang penuh misterius, feel Villainnya lebih kena, beberapa scene juga ada yang tiba-tiba alias Jumping, tapi dibalik itu semua, saya suka bagaimana mereka menciptakan kota yang kacau, amburadul, bener-bener berasa suasananya, harapan saya di Gundala ke dua nanti, semoga kesalahan yang sama tidak diulang.",2.5 stars

Gundala,Anonim,"at its first released, i got so hyped and yelled ""What a great movie!"" then 2 years later i rewatched it, ummm... it was not that good. It's more confusing than entertaining.

Gundala,Anonim,"This movie's heart is in the right place, and there are some good elements here and there. But overall, it's a mess.

Gundala,Anonim,"Overall, this is a genuinely entertaining and satisfying superhero origin story. I dug that it took it's time to build character and especially the world.

Gundala,Anonim,劃錯片買到的票，但預告看起來頗吸引人就決定看了。這是一部很貼近社會底層的印尼超級英雄電影，拍得很認真，雖然一堆美漫畫感超級英雄的片頭有一種詼諧感。主角桑塔加與反派的出身頗雷同，都是沒有父母的孤兒，但主角在遇到困境時被一個較年長孤兒的幫助，讓他也願意向他人伸出援手，而反派大魔王收到卻是眾人滿滿的惡意，被意欲搶奪家產的親戚所害，差點失去生命，但他集合同樣被虐的孤兒向親戚報復，奪回家產後，他以自身財力栽培與他同樣出身的孤兒成為社會菁英，在關鍵時刻用來報復社會。不知道這片是否如實反映印尼雅加達社會現況，是的話蠻可怕的，政府公權力不伸張而墮落，見義勇為的人好心沒有好報，橫死街頭是最有可能的下場。阻擋一個混混恐嚇取財的下場是被集結同夥的混混反過來爆打一頓，就算身手再好也很難一個打十個。因此一些人不反抗，保住性命比較重要，而另一些人則是加入混混的行列。本片完全看不到警察的身影，伸張正義的只有因意外獲得力量的男主角桑塔加。反派報復社會的控訴令人感嘆，他收留的孤兒因母親慘死街頭而無人理會，那些「有道德」的人無人對可憐孤兒伸出援手，是蠻滑坡的想法但可以理解其脈絡是蠻悲哀而扭曲。可惜後面反派養的各界精英小朋友們一一出來跟主角打架，我就開始覺得有一點無聊了，這些精英缺乏自己的想法，就只是「父親」豢養的殺人機器而已。再加上導演打算拍續集，以類似MCU的形式埋了一些哏（居然出現像是宇宙魔方的東西），在快結束的出現了一個前面沒出現的角色，我想就是類似Marvel電影為下一集鋪哏的角色吧，看的當下困惑不已，後來想想如果不熟悉Marvel漫畫故事的人看某些MCU電影，應該也會有同樣的困惑吧。蠻喜歡年幼的桑塔加遇見教他防身術的街頭少年那段，一打五的少年身手很帥氣，他教桑塔加工夫的場景是在一個類似破舊的火車站的地方，那個場景很像破爛十倍的台北機廠的組立工廠，拍攝角度很有香港功夫片感，場景雖破敗但有一種壯闊的美感。,3.0 stars

Mencuri Raden Saleh,Anonim,"Mencuri Raden Saleh (2022)Mencuri Raden Saleh bukan sekadar film perampokan biasa. Angga Dwimas Sasongko berhasil meramu sebuah tontonan yang stylish, penuh ketegangan, dan dibalut dengan identitas Indonesia yang kuat. Premisnya sederhana namun brilian: sekelompok anak muda dengan berbagai keahlian direkrut untuk mencuri lukisan bersejarah karya Raden Saleh dari istana kepresidenan. Kedengarannya gila, bukan?

Tapi keberanian untuk mencoba genre baru bagi keberagaman film Indonesia khususnya ranah blockbuster. Dan untungnya hal itu diwujudkan dengan memanfaatkan aktor-aktor yang punya fanbase sehingga mampu menjadi film yang laris.

Semua cast utama bisa akting, walaupun ada beberapa dialog yang cringe. Tapi tentu bukan karena akting pemainnya, melainkan dialognya karena memang performa pemainnya sudah sebagus itu. Aku kok ya terpesona dengan Iqbaal, untuk beberapa bulan terakhir mukanya muncul terus di FYP TikTok dan Explore Instagram. Padahal dulu sering banget nyinyirin temenku yang ngefans sama Iqbaal. Sekarang ada rasa kagum pada sosok aktor sekaligus penyanyi itu, apalagi semenjak aku versi gondrong dimiripin sama Iqbaal versi gondrong oleh temen kuliahku. Pede banget ya.",4.5 stars

Saya pribadi setuju bahwa film ini berhasil membawa wajah baru di industri film Indonesia, membawa industri film Indonesia sedikit naik kelas dari sebelumnya.Film bergenre heist mungkin masih sangat jarang di Indonesia, dan Visinema berhasil menambah salah satu daftar film baru di Indonesia.

Kerumitan cerita yang diramu cukup untuk menjadi awal dan standarisasi terhadap kelanjutan film dengan genre heist di industri perfilman Indonesia.

Mencuri Raden Saleh,Anonim,"Boleh dibilang, tema yang diusung film garapan Angga Dwimas Sasongko satu ini adalah langka di industri film Indonesia. Cerita pencurian seperti ini haruslah digarap dengan cerdas dan hati-hati, dan film ini berhasil melaksanakan tugasnya dengan baik. Plotnya tersusun runtut dan rapi. Ketegangan yang diberikan juga lumayan memompa adrenalin. Dari departement akting, para pemain memerankan peran mereka dengan baik sesuai porsinya. Mereka telah membuktikan bahwa mereka adalah aktor-aktris berbakat yang tak hanya modal tampang saja. Sedikit pelintiran twist di akhir, walau tak terduga masih agak kurang mulus masuknya. Terlepas dari itu, Mencuri Raden Saleh telah menetapkan standar baru dalam film genre aksi Indonesia.",4.0 stars
Mencuri Raden Saleh,Anonim,"Stealing Raden Saleh is a must-watch for anyone who loves heist films and it takes the best out of the genre. Car chases, fighting sequences and elaborate plans, it has it all. And not just that, the cinematography is great and the score knows how to create tension in all the right moments.All of the six actors have a great chemistry and each of them gets their own spotlight.

Mencuri Raden Saleh,Anonim,"🖼💰🚔I'm quiet happy that Indonesia's movie industry is growing and trying to explore this kind of genre and style.Pros:- Certified as fresh movie for an Indonesia's production- Better camera technique than any usual Indonesia's movie (especially the scene at the final act when camera shot from above after Piko and Ucup left the house by driving a van, it followed the van and then got into the van)Cons:- The story and the plot are…",3.5 stars
Mencuri Raden Saleh,Anonim,"parere estremamente personale, eh, ma quando una cinematografia non americana fa un film ""che sembra americano"" è sempre una prova di forza tanto impressionante quanto priva di fascino. ok avete fatto ocean's eleven indonesiano con un centesimo del budget. bravi, ma quindi? dov'è il valore aggiunto? c'è un solo motivo per cui guardare questo e non ocean's eleven? ero partito con le migliori intenzioni ma dopo circa un'ora ero col telefono in mano che guardavo foto di mads mikkelsen alla milano fashion week",2.0 stars
Mencuri Raden Saleh,Anonim,This movie plot is a new territory for Indonesian films and i hope they explore more henceforth. It shows how a portrait forger steals a invaluable painting in order to save his dad and gets himself and his bunch into trouble and finds a way outta it. Director did not lag anywhere in moving the storyline by maintaining the steady pace. Perfect selection of casts is an added advantage and no deviation from the story did not create any bump in the movie. Worth watching!,4.0 stars

Durasi filmnya yang cukup lama 2.30 jam bener-bener ga kerasa karena emang pacenya cepet dan padet, gw samsek ga ngantuk padahal sebelum nonton abis nyetir perjalanan jauh.

Third act benar benar terasa keren dengan segala ide cemerlang nan pintar mas Angga Sasongko, shout out to you⭐. Keren Iqbaal bisa ngelukis Penangkapan Pangeran Diponegoro sedetail itu. Reza Hilman sama Aghniny keren sampe pada applause tadi👏Sponsornya gak sebanyak Gatotkaca tapi kurang rapih pelatakannya dan berulang. Back story Ucup gak ada.

The story is pretty complex, and it's a bit long at two and a half hours, but it doesn't waste any time. The production quality is on par with foreign heist movies — it looks expensive. The advertisements are also inserted pretty seamlessly and don't get in the way. There are some plot holes and anti-climax scenes, but they're still understandable. Overall, it's an enjoyable watch.",3.5 stars

Mencuri Raden Saleh,Anonim,"How did I not even know about Mencuri Raden Saleh until now? This movie is a breath of fresh air for Indonesian cinema, which usually leans towards horror or action. It’s a heist film with a perfect blend of action, drama, and humor, and the cast absolutely delivers. You can spot some influences from big international heist movies, but it has that unique Indonesian vibe that makes it stand out. Huge respect to the directors for breaking new ground and showing just how versatile Indonesian cinema can be!",4.0 stars
